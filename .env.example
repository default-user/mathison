# Environment Variables

## Required Variables

### Storage Configuration
MATHISON_STORE_BACKEND=FILE
MATHISON_STORE_PATH=./data/mathison

### Genome Configuration (PRODUCTION CRITICAL)
# Path to the verified, signed genome file
# In production: MUST point to a genome signed with a production key
# In development: Can use genomes/TOTK_ROOT_v1.0.0/genome.json (test key)
MATHISON_GENOME_PATH=./genomes/TOTK_ROOT_v1.0.0/genome.json

## Optional Variables

### Server Configuration
# MATHISON_SERVER_PORT=3000
# MATHISON_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0

## Sensitive Variables (NEVER COMMIT)

### Genome Signing (for genome generation only, not runtime)
# Only needed when signing genomes, never in production runtime
# GENOME_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY=<base64-encoded-private-key>

## Production Notes

1. **MATHISON_GENOME_PATH**: In production, this MUST point to a genome signed with a production key. See PRODUCTION_REQUIREMENTS.md for details.

2. **GENOME_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY**: This is ONLY used during genome signing operations (via scripts/genome-sign.ts). It should NEVER be set in production runtime environments. Keep private keys in secure secret management systems.

3. **Key Rotation**: When rotating genome signing keys, generate a new keypair, update the genome's authority.signers, re-sign, and deploy the new genome.
